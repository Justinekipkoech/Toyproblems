## Grade generator
I used control flow to generate grades where it prompts the user to key in the marks to be able to grade from 'A' to 'E'
### CarSpeed detector
I used control flow to enter the speed of cars and and this detects if the vehicle is overspeeding or maintaining the speedlimit and this prompts the traffic to either demerit points or cancel the driving license.
#### Net salary calculator
Here in my codes, i proceeded ahead with calculating the salary of an employee where the user gets a prompt to input his or her basic salary and through control flow method, he/she is able to know the amount of salary to be deducted from the account.
